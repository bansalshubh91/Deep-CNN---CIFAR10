# Deep-CNN---CIFAR10
Trained a deep convolutional neural network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolutional network used (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop/ADAM, and (C) data augmentation. Compared dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation. The model achieved 87% Test Accuracy.
